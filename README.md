> *Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce **InfiniteYou (InfU)**, one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Example

This node adds InfiniteYou‚ÄëFLUX support to ComfyUI. In [infinite_you_workflow.json](./examples/infinite_you_workflow.json), you can find a simple workflow demonstrating its usage with either an empty face‚Äëpose control image or a real face‚Äëpose control image, configured to run using FLUX FP8 precision. It also shows an example running the node with FLUX.1-schnell.

![basic workflow](examples/workflow.jpg)

**Extension:** We also provide an example [multi-id workflow](examples/multi_id_infinite_you_workflow.json) for identity-preserved image generation of two people. This uses the masked multi-region test of single-ID InfiniteYou‚ÄëFLUX models with masked residual blending, and is provided for reference only.

## üîß Requirements and Installation

### Dependencies

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started).

2. Clone this repo under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` and install the dependencies:
```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/ComfyUI_InfiniteYou.git

cd ComfyUI_InfiniteYou
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Our InfiniteYou node has been added to the official Comfy Registry to ease installation: https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/yuminjia/nodes/infiniteyou. Therefore, you can also search `ComfyUI_InfiniteYou` in the ComfyUI Node Manager to install this official node.


### Memory Requirements

The full-performance BF16 model inference requires a peak VRAM of around **43GB**. Running with FP8 precision requires a peak VRAM of around **24GB**.


## üí° Usage

1. Restart ComfyUI.

2. Import the [workflow](examples/infinite_you_workflow.json) from the [examples folder](./examples). Please use [multi-id workflow](examples/multi_id_infinite_you_workflow.json) if needed.

* Some [important usage tips](https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou?tab=readme-ov-file#-important-usage-tips) can be found in our main InfiniteYou repository.


## üè∞ Required Models

### InfiniteYou and InsightFace Detection Models

This node will automatically download the following models at runtime if they not exists. Alternatively, you may download them manually into the following locations. For InfiniteYou, you need at least `image_proj_model.bin` and `infusenet_.*safetensors` of the corresponding model versions.

| Model | Location |
| ---- | ---- |
| [InfiniteYou](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/InfiniteYou/tree/main/infu_flux_v1.0) | `ComfyUI/models/infinite_you/` |
| [InsightFace AntelopeV2](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/InfiniteYou/tree/main/supports/insightface/models/antelopev2) | `ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2` |

You may follow [ComfyUI FLUX examples](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/flux/) to download FLUX and other models for full-performance inference.  


### Other Required Models for Running FP8 Precision

The FP8 InfiniteYou model can also be downloaded automatically or manually as above. To run with FP8 precision, other models need to be downloaded manually into the following locations.

| Model | Location |
| ---- | ---- |
| [FLUX FP8](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/flux-fp8/tree/main) | `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` |
| [FLUX VAE](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/blob/main/ae.safetensors) | `ComfyUI/models/vae` |
| [Text Encoders FP8](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main) | `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders` |
